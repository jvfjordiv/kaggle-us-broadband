# US Broadband Availability

This is a Github repository for our work on the Kaggle project "US Broadband Availability": https://www.kaggle.com/mmattson/us-broadband-availability.

This dataset is comprised of 23 attributes, related to their population statistics, including some about broadband availability and their providers for each county in the United States.

The main notebook can be found in folder `notebooks/develop`.

## Instructions

Run the following:
```
git clone jvfjordiv/kaggle-us-broadband
cd kaggle-us-broadband
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

`run.py` will run all scripts found in `src`. They can't be run individually.
* This argument can disable graphics generation when analyzing the dataset in order to improve speed: `--gengraph no`.
* The regression method can be specified with another argument `--regression LR` for Linear, `--regression DTR` for Decision Tree, and `-regression RFR` for Random Forest. If not specified, it will run all of them, and the best regressor method will output.

Requirements needed:
* `matplotlib`
* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `scikit_learn`
* `seaborn`
* `joblib` (just for dumping models for `run.py`)
